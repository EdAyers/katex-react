# What is it?

It's a fork of [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX).

- Uses typescript instead of flow.
- React from the bottom up.

# Why?

Because it is very hard to get mathjax or katex working with react.
Because I was investigating writing a wysiwyg editor for maths.

# Status

Very WIP.
I have this working on my personal website, this is an attempt to turn it into a package.
At the moment it is just a code dump from my private project. The hope is to eventually get it to the point where you can npm-install it and use it like any other package.
